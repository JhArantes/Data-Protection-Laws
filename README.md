# 📜 **General Data Protection Law (LGPD): Privacy and Security in the Digital Age**  

## 🔍 **Introduction**  

The protection of personal data has become an **essential** topic in the digital world. The **LGPD** (General Data Protection Law) is a regulatory framework that defines how companies and public entities must handle personal information, ensuring **privacy** and **security**.  

📌 **In this work, we cover:**  
- 🛡️ The importance of data security;  
- 🔒 What **personal data** and **sensitive data** are;  
- ⚖️ The legal and historical basis of privacy;

## 1️⃣ **🛡️ Why is Data Security Important?**  

Protecting data goes beyond preventing leaks:

- 🔐 Ensure only **authorized individuals** can access it;  
- 📜 Comply with **laws** and corporate norms.  

### 🏥 **Practical Example: Pharmacies and CPF**

- � **Health history** (diseases, medications).  

⚠️ **Risks:**  
- 📉 Data sold without consent;  
- 🕵️♂️ Exposure to **scammers**.  

The **LGPD** exists to prevent such abuses!

### 📝 **Personal Data**  
Any information that **identifies** an individual:  
- 👤 Name, ID, CPF;
