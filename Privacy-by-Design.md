# 📜 General Data Protection Law (LGPD): Impacts and Challenges  

## 🏁 **Introduction**  
The LGPD (Law 13.709/2018) radically transformed the handling of personal data in Brazil. Previously seen as "bureaucratic," data management now demands **security**, **transparency**, and **compliance** from companies and public agencies.  

---

## 🔄 **Key Changes**  
- **🔍 Selective collection**: Replaces the _"more data, the better"_ model with minimal necessary collection for a specific purpose.  
- **🔄 Continuous program**: Compliance is not a time-bound project but a **permanent process** of management.  
- **🛡️ Privacy first**: Balances data utility with the rights of data subjects (clients, employees, etc.).  

---

## 🛠️ **4 Steps for LGPD Compliance**  
1. **🔎 *Discover***: Map all personal data (origin, purpose, flows).  
2. **📊 *Manage***: Assess risks and protection (including third parties).  
3. **🔒 *Protect***: Implement policies (e.g., encryption, access control).  
4. **👀 *Monitor***: Audit processes and prevent leaks.

## 💻 **The Role of IT in LGPD**  
Although **not exclusively IT's responsibility**, this area is strategic for:  
- Adopting **Security by Design** and **Privacy by Design** (protection from development).  
- Investing in tools like:  
  - 🛡️ **Encryption** (database protection).  
  - 🚧 **Firewalls** (e.g., WAF for web applications).  
  - 📋 **DLP/CASB** (leak prevention).

## 🏥 **Practical Case: Healthcare (Sensitive Data)**  
Health data faces **stricter rules**:  
- ⚖️ **Legal conflict**: Medical records must be stored for 20 years (vs. LGPD’s right to deletion).  
- 🕵️ **Anonymization**: May limit medical research or business intelligence.  
- ✍️ **Mandatory consent**: Data can only be used with explicit authorization.

## 📌 **Case Study: +Vida Health Provider**  

### 🎬 **Scene 1: HR Leak**  
- **Fact**: A coordinator left medical certificates exposed, and a vendor accessed sensitive data.  
- **🔴 Mistakes**:  
  - Sensitive data in an unprotected location.  
  - Unlocked computer with open systems.  

### � **Scene 2: Data Not Deleted**  
- **Fact**: A client requested deletion, but the company retained their data for 2 years.  
- **🔴 Mistakes**:  
  - Non-compliance with LGPD’s 30-day deadline.  
  - Lack of processes to handle requests.  

### 🎬 **Scene 3: Surprise Audit**  
- **Fact**: The ANPD inspected the company without notice, exposing critical flaws.  
- **⚠️ Consequences**: Risk of fines and reputational damage.

## ✅ **Conclusion**  
The LGPD requires:  
- **🧠 Cultural change** (involving all departments).  
- **🔧 Technological adaptation** (security tools).  
- **⚖️ Respect for data subjects' rights**.  

*Organizations ignoring these practices will face fines, lawsuits, and loss of trust.*
